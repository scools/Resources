#### ['QuantCrit' Critical Race Theory Meets Quantitiave Research](https://github.com/scools/Resources/blob/master/Garcia%20et%20al%202018%20QuantCrit.pdf)
This new extention of Critical Race Theory (CRT) has a focus on education and views data collection and data analysis as socially constructed. It posits that statistics and data use exist within the larger racialized context that makes up the norm in America’s educational systems. However, QuantCrit highlights the value of quantitative methods and statistics use in advancing educational justice and proposes several empirical approaches in engaging in quantitative analyses under a critical lens ([Garcia et al., 2018](https://github.com/scools/Resources/blob/master/Garcia%20et%20al%202018%20QuantCrit.pdf); [Gillborn et al., 2018](https://github.com/scools/Resources/blob/master/Gillborn%20et%20al%202018%20QuantCrit.pdf))

#### [Racial Equity in Reporting from Anne E. Casey Foundation](http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/morerace.pdf)
This framework and [action guide](http://www.aecf.org/resources/race-equity-and-inclusion-action-guide/) focus on creating data products that intentionally speak to the circumstances children experience, highlighting systems rather than problematizing youth. Both offer language to describe racial inequities as factors that shape opportunities, and view data reports as tools to identify how to remove barriers to opportunity.
